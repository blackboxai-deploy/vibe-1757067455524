# Sports Prediction App - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Core Structure & Types
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for predictions and teams
- [x] Set up AI client configuration with OpenRouter endpoint
- [x] Create teams database with popular sports teams
- [x] Set up utility functions

## Phase 2: Backend API Development
- [x] Implement prediction API endpoint (`/api/predict`)
- [x] Implement teams suggestion API endpoint (`/api/teams`)
- [x] Implement history API endpoint (`/api/history`)
- [x] Configure AI integration with specialized sports analysis prompt

## Phase 3: Frontend Components
- [x] Create main app layout with navigation
- [x] Build PredictionForm component with team input
- [x] Build TeamSearch component with autocomplete
- [x] Build PredictionResults component with visual indicators
- [x] Build HistoryList component for previous predictions
- [x] Create LoadingSpinner component

## Phase 4: Main Page Implementation
- [x] Implement main page with prediction interface
- [x] Integrate all components with state management
